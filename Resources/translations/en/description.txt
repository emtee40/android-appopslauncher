AppOps Launcher

This is just a launcher for App Ops that is present in Android 4.3 and 4.4.x, and this doesn't work on all devices.

For some devices it doesn't require root for some it does, test it to see if your device will work without root.

You should have the ability to deny any application access to your phone hardware, resources, or data, this will help you do it.

If you find a device that this works on, tell me so I can add it.

Released as open source, you can view the code at https://github.com/ilijamt/android-appopslauncher
