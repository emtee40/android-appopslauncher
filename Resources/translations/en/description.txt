AppOps Launcher

This is just a launcher for App Ops that is present in Android 4.3+, and this doesn't work on all devices.
If you find a device that this works on, tell me so I can add it.

Doesn't require **root** to run.

Released as open source, you can view the code at https://github.com/ilijamt/android-appopslauncher
